# T-Lab
T-Spline surface constructor

This code is to build a T-spline surfac eby MATLAB


how to build a T-spline surface:
step 1: build a 3 dimensional matrix with size (n+1)*(m+1)*4  control mesh named (cp if you want), the third dimension means (X,Y,Z,weight) coordinate
step 2: Name_of_surface = T_Surface(cp), and now you build a T-spline NURBS surface in T-spine format

how to illustrate T-spline surface:
